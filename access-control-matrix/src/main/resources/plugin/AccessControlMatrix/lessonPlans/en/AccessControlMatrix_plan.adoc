== Using an Access Control Matrix

In a role-based access control scheme, a role represents a set of access permissions and privileges. A user can be assigned one
or more roles. A role-based access control scheme normally consists of two parts: role permission management and role assignment.
A broken role-based access control scheme might allow a user to perform accesses that are not allowed by his/her assigned roles,
or somehow allow privilege escalation to an unauthorized role.
